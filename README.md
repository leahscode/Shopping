# Welcome to my Shopping App

A pretend shopping app, this program uses Tkinter and SQLite for an easy-to-use interface. SQLite is a small, one-file database, ideal for low-traffic applications. In this case, it is stored on the userâ€™s computer, alongside the Python files. The program was adapted from a school project that used text files and demonstrates the use of classes and inheritance.
